<h2>Sketching Core Library</h2> 
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Sketching Core Library provides a range of stochastic streaming algorithms and closely 
  related java technologies that are particularly useful when integrating this technology into 
  systems that must deal with massive data. Click on the package links below for the package 
  introduction and APIs.
</p>

<p>This library is divided into packages that constitute distinct groups of functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/frequencies/package-summary.html">Frequencies</a></b>
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/hash/package-summary.html">Hash</a></b>
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/hll/package-summary.html">HLL</a></b> 
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/hllmap/package-summary.html">HLLMap</a></b> 
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/quantiles/package-summary.html">Quantiles</a></b> 
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/sampling/package-summary.html">Sampling</a></b>
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/theta/package-summary.html">Theta</a></b>
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/tuple/package-summary.html">Tuple</a></b>
</li>
</ul>
Note: In general, if the requirements or promises of any method's contract are not fulfilled 
(that is, if there is a bug in either the method or its caller), 
then an unchecked exception will be thrown. 
The precise type of such an unchecked exception does not form part of any method's contract.
