/**
 * <p>The memory package contains classes that extend the Java Unsafe class and provide
 * direct primitive and array access to off-heap memory as well as compatible views into heap-based 
 * arrays and the Java ByteBuffer class.  These classes provide the foundation for building and 
 * managing sketchs and set operations in off-heap memory.  This package is general purpose,
 * has no external dependencies and can be used in any application that needs to manage data 
 * structures outside the Java heap.
